PDF file was manually converted to .csv in Excel. The .csv version is available in the github data folder as "statePartyRAW.csv". 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# load libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
# import csv

import <- read_csv(here("code/data/statePartyRAW.csv"))
```
```{r}
# remove AK and HI

df <- filter(import, stateAB != "AK")
df2 <- filter(df, stateAB != "HI")

```

```{r}
# save as new .csv

write_csv(df2, here("code/data/stateParty.csv"))

```
